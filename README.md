This program is used to generate and verify digital signatures using the RSA algorithm. A digital signature is a cryptographic mechanism used to ensure the integrity and authenticity of a message or document.

The program consists of two main parts:

    Signature generator: This part of the program generates a digital signature for a specified message or document. To do this, the program uses an RSA private key to encrypt a hash of the message or document.
    Signature verifier: This part of the program verifies the validity of a digital signature. To do this, the program uses an RSA public key to decrypt the encrypted hash and compare it to the hash of the original message or document. If the two hashes match, then the signature is valid.

The program provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to allow users to easily generate and verify digital signatures. The GUI includes input fields for entering the message or document, the digital signature, and the public key. It also includes buttons for generating and verifying signatures, and a label to show the signature status.

The program uses the following Python libraries:

    hashlib: This library provides functions for generating data hashes.
    rsa: This library provides functions for generating and using RSA keys.
    tkinter: This library provides tools for creating graphical user interfaces.
